# java_mysql

Why:

This was a project i was busy with in school when working in a team. 
Its code that can send querys with jdbc mysql and show contents from a database.
It was made for a rythmgame we were working on, and i was chozen to make a working query sender and data from a database receiver.

How to run:

1. Download the files
2. use eclipse (i haven't tested it yet on other ide's)
3. import the project in eclipse
4. make sure the buildpath is correct so the driver is found (if not it wont work)
5. and now you can change the strings in the class for your specific database connection
